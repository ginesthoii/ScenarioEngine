A general-purpose stochastic simulation framework for timeline-based systems. Models outcomes driven by historical or synthetic data sequences, probabilistic variation, and defined failure states. Useful for finance, homesteading, livestock cycles, solar/battery resilience, and other sequential-risk domains.
